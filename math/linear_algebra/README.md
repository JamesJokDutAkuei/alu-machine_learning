# Linear Algebra with Python ðŸ§®

**Author:** Alexa Orrico, Software Engineer at Holberton School  
**Track:** Machine Learning @ ALU  
**Weight:** 2  
**Duration:** May 18â€“24, 2025  

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

This project introduces foundational concepts in Linear Algebra using Python. The tasks emphasize matrix manipulation, vector operations, and NumPy basics. The goal is to develop an intuitive understanding of arrays, shapes, slicing, broadcasting, dot products, and matrix operations.

This project is part of the Machine Learning curriculum and contributes to building efficient numerical computation skills needed for ML and AI.
